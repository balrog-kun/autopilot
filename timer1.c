 * little later than expected, but not sooner than expected.  This is
 * guaranteed, but the "little later" can be rather long in extreme
 * cases.  It will be reasonably short if callback routines are reasonably
 * short.  Timeouts being set need to be within 2^32 / F_CPU / 2 seconds
 * from now, which is about 120 seconds at 16MHz.
 *
 * Callbacks currently run with interrupts enabled in order let the timer
 * overflow do its job, but if the callbacks don't take too long, they
 * could be given the comfort of interrupts disabled which would simplify
